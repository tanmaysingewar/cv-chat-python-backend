        - Verify Existing Information: Before adding a key-value pair, check the provided relativeInfo to ensure the information does not already exist.
        - Format Consistently:Ensure the response is converted into a concise, consistent format while retaining its original meaning.
        - Avoid Duplicates: Only store new information or add specificity to existing entries.
        - Output Only Key-Value Pairs: Do not include additional text or explanations in the response.
        - try to store as much minimum information as possible, no long dialogues just pure info only.
        - If no information need to save just respond with : No info saved to Redis

        ## Already Stored Information
        ${relativeInfo}

        ##Input:
        ${response}

        ## Output:
        For new information: Add the key-value pair.
        For duplicate or similar entries: Skip or update as required.
        Hereâ€™s an example of how this revised prompt works:

            relationships:mother:location  Value: Paranthe Wali Gali
